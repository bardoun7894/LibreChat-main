## Context
This transformation represents a fundamental shift from LibreChat's single-purpose chat interface to a comprehensive AI-powered SaaS platform. The change involves multiple architectural layers, new business models, and complex integrations with various AI service providers. The platform must serve both Arabic and English markets while maintaining high performance and scalability.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: 
  - Create a unified AI platform with multiple services
  - Implement bilingual support with proper RTL handling
  - Establish subscription-based revenue model
  - Enable extensibility through MCP and n8n
  - Maintain high performance across all AI services
- Non-Goals:
  - Support for more than 2 languages in initial release
  - On-premises deployment options (cloud-only initially)
  - Free tier with unlimited usage
  - Custom AI model training

## Decisions
- Decision: Microservices architecture for different AI tools
  - Rationale: Allows independent scaling, development, and deployment of different AI services
  - Alternatives considered: Monolithic architecture (rejected for scalability concerns)
  
- Decision: Stripe for payment processing
  - Rationale: Industry standard, robust API, supports multiple currencies
  - Alternatives considered: PayPal, Adyen (rejected for limited Arabic market support)
  
- Decision: MCP for extensibility
  - Rationale: Emerging standard for AI tool integration, future-proof
  - Alternatives considered: Custom plugin system (rejected for maintenance overhead)
  
- Decision: n8n for workflow automation
  - Rationale: Open-source, visual workflow builder, extensive integrations
  - Alternatives considered: Zapier (rejected for cost), custom solution (rejected for complexity)

## Risks / Trade-offs
- **Complexity Risk**: Managing multiple AI service integrations
  - Mitigation: Standardized API wrapper layer, comprehensive monitoring
  
- **Cost Risk**: High API costs from multiple AI providers
  - Mitigation: Usage tracking, tier limits, cost optimization algorithms
  
- **Performance Risk**: Latency from multiple external services
  - Mitigation: Caching strategies, queue management, CDN usage
  
- **Security Risk**: Managing multiple API keys and user data
  - Mitigation: Key rotation policies, encryption, audit logging
  
- **Trade-off**: Feature richness vs. simplicity
  - Decision: Prioritize core features, add advanced features incrementally

## Migration Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Core platform architecture and bilingual chat
2. **Phase 2**: Image and video generation services
3. **Phase 3**: Code generation and design analysis
4. **Phase 4**: MCP and n8n integration
5. **Phase 5**: Subscription system and launch
6. **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain LibreChat compatibility mode during transition
